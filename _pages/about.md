I am a PhD student in ETH ZÃ¼rich under the supervision of [Thomas Hofmann](http://www.da.inf.ethz.ch/people/ThomasHofmann). 
I earned my bachelor in Electrical & Computer Engineering in [NTUA ECE](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/en) and my master in Data Science
in [ETH ZÃ¼rich](https://ethz.ch/en/studies/master/degree-programmes/engineering-sciences/data-science.html). 

My interests lie in representation learning and inductive biases of machine learning architectures. On my free time I work on improving 
Large Langunage Models.

Outside machine learning, I am known to be addicted to [Kondi](https://www.asvz.ch/sport/45675-kondi). Currently working on my ðŸŽ¾ skills.
